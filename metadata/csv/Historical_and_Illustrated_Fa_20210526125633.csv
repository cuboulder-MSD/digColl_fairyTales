First published in 1825, the Kleine Ausgabe was a collection of fifty tales from the Grosse Ausgabe (Large Edition) originally published by the Grimms in two volumes in 1812 and 1815. The original Grosse Ausgabe contained 156 tales and was not immediately popular; for this reason, the streamlined Kleine Ausgabe was published in part to appeal to a broader middle-class audience. Among the tales included in the Kleine Ausgabe are the Grimms' versions of Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin, and Cinderella.","","","","","","","text","Material is in the public domain.

The Pleasant Nights contains many different types of tales, including realistic novellas, stories about practical jokes, tragic and triumphant love stories, bawdy tales, and animal stories. Some sixteen of these 74 tales are fairy tales. Straparola is the author of Puss-in-Boots, the story of an impoverished boy whose enchanted cat earns him wealth, marriage to a princess, and a kingdom. Among the other fairy tales in The Pleasant Nights, we find a dragon slayer tale; the tale of a prince born in the shape of a pig due to a fairy's curse who regains his human form only after marrying three times; the story of Biancabella or ""White Beauty"" a princes who undergoes many trials until finally being saved by a fairy; and the a poor girl who acquire a magic doll that poops money and helps her marry a prince. We know very little about the life of Giovanfrancesco Straparola. He most likely was born in Caravaggio, Italy around 1480 and probably died in or near Venice around 1557. Besides his collection of tales, The Pleasant Nights, he wrote a collection of poetry published in 1508. Even his name is a mystery: ""Straparola"" translates roughly as ""too wordy"" or ""The Babbler"". Straparola's The Pleasant Nights was an early modern bestseller reprinted some twenty times in Italy between 1551 and 1620. The 1608 edition displayed here contains charming woodcuts that illustrate key scenes from the tales.","","","","","","","text","","","","","","","","","","","20090220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hicks, Alison","scanning technician","host","b3828988x","http://libraries.colorado.edu/record=b3828988~S3","Le","tredici piacevolissime notte","","","","","Straparola, Giovanni Francesco","ca. 1480-1557?","naf","personal","Author","","","","","","","","","","","text","Venetia","Z.

Between 1560 (the publication of the Volume I) and 1615, the translation of The Pleasant Nights had become one of the most popular tale collections published in France, with editions printed in Lyons, Paris, and Rouen. Through these translations, Straparola's tales came to have a great influence on the French literary fairy tale tradition, an influence that French authors readily admitted. For example, in her preface to her own collection of tales, Sublime and Allegorical Stories (1699), one of France's earliest fairy tale authors, Mme Henriette-Julie de Murat, told her readers, ""I am pleased to indicate two things to the Reader. The first is that I took the ideas for some of these tales from and earlier Author entitled Les facétieuses nuits due Seigneur Straparole, printed for the sixteenth time in 1615. These Tales were apparently very fashionable during the last century, as there has been so much discussed about this book. The Ladies who have written up until now in this genre [the fairy tale] have drawn from the same source, at least for the most part. The second thing that I have to say is that my Tales were written since last April, and that if there are similarities with one of these Ladies in discussing some of my Subjects, I did not use any model other than the original, which will be easy to prove by the different paths we have taken."" Ladies such as Marie-Catherine d'Aulnoy were not the only authors to borrow plots from Straparola; male writers such as Charles Perrault did the same. Written in Neapolitan dialect rather than standard literary Italian, Basile's fairy tales would wait many centuries to be translated into other languages. Indeed, the first Italian translation of The Tale of Tales appeared only in 1747, more than a hundred years after the first Neapolitan edition was printed. Scholars believe, however, that French authors such as Charles Perrault had access to Basile's tales in the original Neapolitan. Most likely, Basile's tales entered France by way of Antoine Bulifon, a French printer who lived and worked in Naples. Bulifon's book shop was an important stop for French travelers visiting the city, including King Louis XIV's book buyer, Jean Mabillon, who purchased a great number of volumes from Bulifon and shipped them back to Paris.","","","","","","","text","","monographic","","","","","","","","","20090220","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hicks, Alison","scanning technician","host","b54272270","http://libraries.colorado.edu/record=b5427227~S3","Les","facétieuses nuits de Straparole","","","","Piacevoli notti.
